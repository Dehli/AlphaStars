        <h3>What the Program Is</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                We hire for the Alpha Stars Summer Analyst Program (for business majors) and the Alpha Stars Computer Science and Engineering Program (for computer science and engineering majors). We put you into teams where you select a business idea, start building it, get customers or at least start testing live with customers, then pitch it to investors (last year’s judges included people from AlphaLab, Birchmere Ventures, and Alluvial Capital, among others).
            </p>

        <h3>Class of 2015</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                In May 2015 we hired 28 people across business, computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering.  In a few cases we hired existing teams and existing senior design teams already with a functioning product.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are seven teams operating in both the consumer and business to business areas, including sectors like healthcare, technology, physical products, and consumer services.  By August 8 we expect that all teams presenting will either have sold product, are testing their products live with customers, or are about to begin testing live with customers.

        <h3>Why We Started the Program</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                We started this program in order to build a relationship with the best and brightest students and young professionals. We want the people going through the program to develop a solid skill set and be able to compete for the best jobs. For the entrepreneurially-minded, we want you to have the skills to build a business and achieve your best.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also built this Program because we want to work with people who are curious and eager to sharpen their entrepreneurial abilities. Most importantly, the Program will help you to develop a deep skill set in an environment that sharpens your character.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you love to learn, try hard things, push your limits, and work tremendously hard, we encourage you to apply.
